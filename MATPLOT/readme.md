# Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This project demonstrates how to create various types of plots using Matplotlib, a powerful plotting library in Python. It includes examples for line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, histograms, and subplots, as well as customization options such as legends, grid lines, and styling.

## Features

- **Line Plot**: Visualizes data trends with a continuous line.
- **Bar Chart**: Compares different categories with rectangular bars.
- **Scatter Plot**: Displays the relationship between two sets of data as points on a graph.
- **Pie Chart**: Displays data as slices of a circle, representing parts of a whole.
- **Histogram**: Shows the distribution of numerical data into bins.
- **Subplots**: Allows multiple plots to be displayed in a single figure.
- **Customization**: Add titles, legends, markers, grid lines, and other styling elements to plots.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib library

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/matplotlib-visualizations.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python package (Matplotlib):
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory and run the script:
   ```bash
   python matplotlib_visualizations.py
   ```

2. The script will generate and display various types of plots.

## Code Explanation

### 1. **Line Plot**
   - `plt.plot()` is used to plot a simple line graph showing the relationship between `x` and `y`.

### 2. **Bar Chart**
   - `plt.bar()` creates a bar chart comparing different categories. It is useful for showing quantities in different groups.

### 3. **Scatter Plot**
   - `plt.scatter()` creates a scatter plot that visualizes individual data points, typically used for showing correlations.

### 4. **Pie Chart**
   - `plt.pie()` is used to create a pie chart, displaying parts of a whole.

### 5. **Histogram**
   - `plt.hist()` generates a histogram that visualizes the distribution of a dataset into bins.

### 6. **Subplots**
   - `plt.subplots()` allows multiple plots to be shown in the same figure for comparative visualization.

### 7. **Customization**
   - You can customize the plots by adding titles, labels, legends, and adjusting the grid, line styles, markers, and colors.

## Example Plots
- **Line Plot**: A simple trend graph of `y = 2x`.
- **Bar Chart**: Visualizes sales data for different categories.
- **Scatter Plot**: Displays relationships between two variables.
- **Pie Chart**: Shows the percentage distribution of categories.
- **Histogram**: Displays the distribution of numerical data.
